# 👋 About Me
I am **Zexin Feng**. I am a senior undergraduate student at **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China**. I am majoring in Computer Science and expected to graduate in June 2025. My research interests include Computer Vision, Medical Image Processing, Robotics, and Machine Learning. I am currently working in Xiaohui Xie's Lab at the **University of California, Irvine**. I am also a member of the iMED Intelligent Medical Imaging research group at SUSTech, where I have been worked for 2 years. 

I am actively looking for Ph.D. positions in Computer Vision, Medical Image Processing, Robotics, and related fields.
